This is the scripts in the source tarball
at https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/+milestone/4.9-2015-q3-update
after i hacked them to build on ARM linux (to be precise, ubuntu 16.04 xenial on armhf ...)

the resulting binary tarball might be at https://urjaman.ddns.net/gcc-arm-embedded-4_9-2015q3-linux-armhf.tar.bz2 

(the build scripts named it 2017q4 based on the date, but I didnt touch the actual sources, so i renamed
that tarball... the contents havent been touched so the dir is still 2017q4...)
